<h1>The labryinth of Suffering</h1>
<p>Suffering, might sound a heavy word  to us adoloscents.
  <br> But we never know that the one of the main cause of our suffering in later age might start in our tender age as well. 
  <br> In fact, most of the teenagers of present generation are suffering from depression, secretly. And the most shocking part 
  is
 they have mastered the art of concealing their thoughts, their inner feelings, soo perfectly that if they ever, 
  ever break down and burst up into tears, letting out all their bottled up emotions, the senior , mature and "understanding" 
  department of the house would then start questioning
  their own life,their own brain and their own bond between the children. It was never a bond for few, justa formality in which 
  they only did the hearing of scorns
  The youngsters are given soo much exposure, that it leads them to overthink soo deeply and leads them into despair. 
  This does not mean that
  a parent should prevent a child from getting such an exposure,because that would lead to the feeling of being excluded
  and left over among the friends.
  Who says that the children know nothing about the society? They do know, dont underestimate them, please. 
  They know much about  society, at least of theirs, if not of the society,
  the parents always refer to, and before anyone asks, yes there is a society among youngsters.
  
  Many writers have written about the problems that teenagers face. Some of these books are
  <ul>
    <li>Looking For Alaska</li>
    <li>The Alchemist</li>
    <li>The fault in our Stars</li>
  </ul>
    The maze or labryinth of Suffering is shown in the looking for Alaska. It can be depicted by the following table
    
    <table style="width:80%">
  <tr>
    <th>   Trouble  </th>
    <th>   Trouble  </th> 
    <th>   Trouble  </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>   Trouble  </td>
    <td>   THE PERSON AND HIS COMFORT ZONEE </td> 
    <td>   Trouble  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>   Trouble  </td>
    <td>   Trouble  </td> 
    <td>   Trouble  </td>
  </tr>
</table>
    The person does not know how to deal with all the problems.He gets stuck like one in a maze. He gives up, and make his own comfort corner and accepts that is his life. This is the labyrinth of Suffering
